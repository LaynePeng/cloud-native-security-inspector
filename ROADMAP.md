# Roadmap of Project Narrows (as of Dec. 2023)
This document outlines the new features and improvements that are being considered for the future releases of Narrows. The intention is to provide the Narrows contributors and users with a clear understanding of what features they can expect to see in the near future, as well as to encourage feedback and ideas from the community.

Please note that priorities for the project may change over time, and this roadmap is subject to evolution. If a feature is not listed now, it does not mean that it will not be considered for Narrows in the future. We welcome suggestions and ideas from everyone about the roadmap and Narrows features.
